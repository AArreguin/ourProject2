#Self Critque Memo

Honestly, for the project I like the way our website came out. Welcome pages works extremely well on mobile and desktop.
As terms of how I feel like I'm doing in HTML, I would say better. As, I started noticing more of a habit adding on tags without
visual studio creating suggested tags, and little to no validation errors every time I run the validator.
